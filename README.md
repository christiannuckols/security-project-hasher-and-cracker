# security-project-hasher-and-cracker
Creates 100 all-digit passwords, hashes them with md5, sha256, and salted sha256.  Then, a seperate executable accepts a hashed database and cracks a password with a brute-force test.  Note that this project is for security testing purposes only, and only creates passwords of up to 9 *digits*, with no alphabetical characters.
